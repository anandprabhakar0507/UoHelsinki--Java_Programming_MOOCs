# UoHelsinki--Java_Programming_MOOCs

Developed on Netbeans 8.2, JDK 8.

Notable exercises that required independent work (independent as in they didn't walk me through how to create the project)
 * [Week  7, exercise  8:  Airport](https://github.com/nnard1616/UoHelsinki--Java_Programming_MOOCs/tree/master/2013-OOProgrammingWithJava-PART2/week7-week7_08.Airport/src)
 * [Week  8, exercise 16:  SkiJumping](https://github.com/nnard1616/UoHelsinki--Java_Programming_MOOCs/tree/master/2013-OOProgrammingWithJava-PART2/week8-week8_16.SkiJumping/src)
 * [Week  9, exercise 26:  PhoneSearch](https://github.com/nnard1616/UoHelsinki--Java_Programming_MOOCs/tree/master/2013-OOProgrammingWithJava-PART2/week9-week9_26.PhoneSearch/src)
 * [Week 10, exercise 33:  Dungeon](https://github.com/nnard1616/UoHelsinki--Java_Programming_MOOCs/tree/master/2013-OOProgrammingWithJava-PART2/week10-week10_33.Dungeon/src/dungeon)   <-- Best project
 * [Week 12, exercise 49:  WormGame](https://github.com/nnard1616/UoHelsinki--Java_Programming_MOOCs/tree/master/2013-OOProgrammingWithJava-PART2/week12-week12_49.WormGame/src/wormgame)  <-- Most complicated, but was a walkthrough project (they told me what to do)
